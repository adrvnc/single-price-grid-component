## My Process


### Built With 

- HTML 
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5.1.3
### What I Learned 

I figured out how to override Bootstrap CSS styles by using the 
`!important` property; I created custom styles for the "sign up" 
button and the background color using that method. 
### Continued Development 

I aim for a better understanding of Bootstrap's Grid System. 
It was an integral part of the development of this project; 
I know I'm going to be using it more in future projects.
### Useful Resources
